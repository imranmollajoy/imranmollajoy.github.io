Are you tired of dealing with ads and pop-ups in your video and music players, or when reading documents on your phone? You're not alone! Fortunately, there are some great apps available that can help you enjoy your favorite media and documents without the annoyance of ads. Here are a few of my favorites, which are all free and ad-free

## Video Player (VLC)

Replaces: MX Player, MX Player Pro

You may have heard of VLC before, as it is a popular and versatile video player that is widely used on computers. However, did you know that VLC is also available for your phone? This means you can use it to play a wide range of video files on your mobile device, and enjoy all of the features and functionality that you would expect from a desktop video player. One of the main advantages of using VLC on your phone is that it is ad-free, which means you can watch your videos without interruptions or distractions. So, if you're looking for a powerful and ad-free video player for your phone, give VLC a try!
