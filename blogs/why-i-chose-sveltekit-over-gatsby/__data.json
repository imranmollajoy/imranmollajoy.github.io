Gastby is slow, atleast for me.","content":"<blockquote><p>Disclaimer: This is my opinion, this is what works for me. </p></blockquote>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n<p>One answer, speed. Not the speed of end-user website, rather the speed of development.</p>\n<h2>Explanation</h2>\n<p>Gatsby is an awesome framework. It is a react-based framework, mainly a static site generator, but can also be used as SPA and SSR. Gatsby is feature rich, can be extended with a vast number of plugins. However, Gatsby takes a long time to start up a development server, reloading any changes and sometimes just hangs up my entire system.</p>\n<p>Whereas SvelteKit is a Svelte based framework for creating website, pretty similar to Gatsby. SvelteKit development server fires up within a seconds, applies any changes instantly. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Gatsby has many plugins which can do pretty much any functionality you want. I would definitely stick with Gatsby if it wasnâ€™t for the speed. SvelteKit is yet in beta phase, so many features like generating a sitemap, dynamic images are not there out of the box. But those can be done with some time and coding. So yeah, SvelteKit, for now.</p>"}}]}
