In this article, we will explore the differences between SSR and SSG, their respective advantages and disadvantages, and how to decide which approach is best for your specific project.\nWhat is Server-side rendering (SSR)? #Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique in which a web page is rendered on the server in response to a user’s request. This means that when a user visits a website, their browser sends a request to the server, and the server responds by generating and sending back the HTML code for the page. The browser then interprets and displays the HTML to the user.\nAdvantages of SSR #One advantage of SSR is that it can be faster when dealing with a large number of pages. Because the server is responsible for generating the HTML, it can quickly generate and send back many pages at once, which can be useful for websites with a large number of pages or dynamic content. SSR is also useful for websites that require server-side processing, such as authentication, data validation, or server-side rendering of client-side libraries like React or Angular.\nAnother advantage of SSR is that it allows for real-time updates to the page content. Because the server generates the HTML on demand, it can incorporate the latest data or user input into the page, allowing for a seamless and dynamic user experience.\nDisadvantages of SSR #Server-side rendering (SSR) has some disadvantages that may make it less suitable for certain types of projects. One disadvantage is that it can be slower in terms of performance compared to static site generation (SSG). Because the server has to generate and send back the entire HTML code for each page, it can take longer for the page to load, which can be frustrating for users and may reduce the user experience.\nAnother disadvantage of SSR is that it can be more challenging for search engine optimization (SEO). Search engines may have difficulty indexing and ranking pages that are generated on the server, as they may not be able to access and crawl the page content in the same way they can with static HTML files. This can make it harder for your website to rank well in search results, which can reduce its visibility and impact.\nAdditionally, SSR can require more complex server-side infrastructure and code. Because the server has to generate and send back the HTML code for each page, it may require more advanced server-side capabilities and technologies, such as a web application framework, database, or server-side rendering library. This can increase the complexity and cost of development and maintenance, and may make it more difficult to scale and update the website.\nWhat is Static Site Generation(SSG)? #Static site generation (SSG) is a technique in which a website is pre-rendered at build time, rather than being generated on the fly in response to user requests. This means that the entire website is pre-built and saved as a set of static HTML files, which can then be served to users without the need for additional server-side processing.\nAdvantages #SSG has a number of advantages compared to server-side rendering (SSR). One advantage is that it is faster in terms of performance. Because the website is pre-rendered as static HTML files, there is no need for the server to generate and send back the HTML code for each page. This means that the pages can be served to users more quickly, which can improve the user experience and reduce loading times.\nAnother advantage of SSG is that it is simpler and easier to implement and maintain. Because the website is pre-rendered as static HTML files, there is no need for complex server-side infrastructure or code, such as a web application framework, database, or server-side rendering library. This can make it easier to develop and maintain the website, and can reduce the cost and complexity of the project.\nAdditionally, SSG can be more suitable for search engine optimization (SEO). Because the website is pre-rendered as static HTML files, search engines can easily access and crawl the page content, which can improve the website’s ranking in search results and increase its visibility.\nDisadvantages #One potential disadvantage of static site generation (SSG) is that it is limited to static content. Because the website is pre-rendered at build time, it is not possible to include dynamic data or user-generated content on the site. This can be a limitation for some types of websites or applications that require real-time updates or interactivity.\nAnother potential disadvantage of SSG is that it can be challenging to implement certain features or functionality that are commonly found on modern websites, such as forms, search, or e-commerce. These features typically require server-side processing, which is not possible with SSG. This can make it difficult to create a fully-featured website using only SSG.\nAdditionally, SSG may not be suitable for websites or applications that require a high level of security or privacy. Because the website is pre-rendered as static HTML files, it is not possible to implement server-side security measures, such as authentication or encryption. This can make it easier for attackers to access or compromise the website, and can make it difficult to protect sensitive user data.\nVerdict #In conclusion, static site generation (SSG) is a useful web development approach that has several advantages, including faster performance, easier implementation and maintenance, and better search engine optimization (SEO). However, it also has some potential disadvantages, such as its limitation to static content and difficulty in implementing certain features or functionality.\nWhether to use SSG or not ultimately depends on the specific needs and requirements of the website or application being built. For simple, static websites, SSG may be the best approach. But for more complex, dynamic websites, server-side rendering (SSR), may be more suitable. It is also possible to use a hybrid approach that combines both SSG and SSR in different parts of the site.\n","wordCount":"1002","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://imranmollajoy.github.io/images/featured.png","datePublished":"2022-12-08T19:26:52+06:00","dateModified":"2022-12-08T19:26:52+06:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://imranmollajoy.github.io/post/differences-between-ssg-and-spa/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Imran's Site","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://imranmollajoy.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>var dark=document.getElementById("darkIcon");localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?(document.body.classList.add("dark"),document.getElementById("darkIcon").classList.add("active")):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?(document.body.classList.remove("dark"),document.getElementById("darkIcon").classList.remove("active")):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&(document.body.classList.add("dark"),document.getElementById("darkIcon").classList.add("active"))</script><header class="top-nav fixed"><nav><button class="circle transparent material-symbols-outlined" data-ui=#left-menu>
