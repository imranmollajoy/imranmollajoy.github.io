[{"content":" Horizontal Section #A horizontal section is a type of layout in which the content is arranged from left to right, rather than from top to bottom. This design can be elegant and visually appealing, and it can also save space by allowing more content to be displayed on the screen at once. Horizontal sections are commonly used in web design to create menus, galleries, or other types of content that can be easily scrolled through by the user. To create a horizontal section, you can use CSS styles such as display: flex; and flex-wrap: wrap; to control the layout and appearance of the content.\nMaking a horizontal section #Create three files: index.html, index.css, and index.js.

Unfortunately, many people still use simple, easily guessable passwords, leaving themselves vulnerable to hackers and identity theft. In this article, we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss why it\u0026rsquo;s important to use strong, unique passwords and offer some tips for creating them.\nThe importance of strong, unique passwords #In today\u0026rsquo;s digital world, we rely on passwords to protect our personal information and online accounts. From social media and email accounts to online banking and shopping accounts, our passwords play a critical role in keeping our information secure. Unfortunately, many people still use simple, easily guessable passwords, such as \u0026ldquo;password\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;123456,\u0026rdquo; which are easy for hackers to guess and use to gain access to our accounts.\nUsing strong, unique passwords is crucial for protecting your information and preventing unauthorized access to your accounts. Strong passwords are difficult for hackers to guess and can help keep your personal information and online accounts safe.\nTips for creating strong, unique passwords #Creating strong, unique passwords can seem daunting, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be. Here are some tips for creating strong, unique passwords:\nUse a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters #Using a mix of different characters makes your password more difficult to guess. Avoid using simple, easily guessable combinations, such as \u0026ldquo;qwerty\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;abcd,\u0026rdquo; and instead use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters, such as \u0026ldquo;Jsu*10LYa?./@\u0026rdquo;\nAvoid using personal information #Avoid using personal information, such as your name, address, or date of birth, in your password. Hackers can easily guess this type of information and use it to gain access to your accounts.\nUse a passphrase instead of a single word #Instead of using a single word as your password, consider using a passphrase, which is a series of words or a short sentence. For example, instead of using \u0026ldquo;password\u0026rdquo; as your password, use a passphrase like \u0026ldquo;heYY+oK-bYe091!\u0026rdquo; This passphrase is longer and more difficult to guess than a single word.\nUse a password manager #A password manager is a tool that helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for all of your online accounts. A password manager generates random, secure passwords for you and stores them securely, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to remember them all. This can save you time and help ensure that you\u0026rsquo;re using strong, unique passwords for all of your accounts.\nThe role of password managers #The role of password managers is to help users create and store strong, unique passwords for all of their online accounts. Instead of using the same simple, easily guessable password for multiple accounts, a password manager generates random, secure passwords and stores them securely, so users don\u0026rsquo;t have to remember them all. This can save time and help ensure that users are using strong, unique passwords for all of their accounts.\nThere are many password managers available, both commercial and open source. Open source password managers are a good option for those who want a secure, reliable password manager without the cost of a commercial product. I recommend using Bitwarden , fully open source, always free for personal use without any limitation.\nConclusion #In conclusion, using strong, unique passwords is essential for protecting your personal information and online accounts. By following the tips outlined in this article, you can create secure, difficult-to-guess passwords that will help keep your information safe. By taking the time to create strong, unique passwords, you can protect yourself against hackers and other online threats.\n","permalink":"https://imranmollajoy.github.io/post/how-to-create-strong-unique-passwords/","summary":"Creating strong, unique passwords is an essential part of protecting your online accounts and personal information.

The feature, which has been in testing since October, is available on both desktop and mobile versions of Chrome running on Windows 11, macOS, and Android. Google also allows users to sync passkeys from their Android devices to other devices using either Google\u0026rsquo;s own password manager or a third-party one that supports passkeys.\nRead more Why you should use strong and unique password A passkey is a unique identifier that is stored on a device, such as a computer, phone, or USB security key. When used on websites or applications that have implemented the passkey API, it allows users to log in quickly and easily through the use of biometric authentication or other secure authentication methods on their device. This eliminates the need for traditional passwords, providing a more secure and convenient way to access online accounts.\nPasskeys offer an additional layer of security because they do not involve the use of passwords that could potentially be leaked. Furthermore, the major tech companies, including Apple, Google, and Microsoft, are working together to adopt the passkey technology and make it device-agnostic. The technology is built on the FIDO standard, which uses public key cryptography to enable cross-platform compatibility. This allows users to log in securely and easily across multiple devices.\nThe effectiveness of passkeys in Chrome and other browsers ultimately depends on the adoption of the WebAuthn API by websites. This allows websites to accept passkeys as a form of authentication. Some online stores, such as Best Buy, have already implemented the API, and services such as PayPal also support it. As more websites adopt the API, the use of passkeys as a secure and convenient login method will become more widespread.\n","permalink":"https://imranmollajoy.github.io/post/passkeys-now-available-in-chrome/","summary":"No Need of Passwords Anymore #Google has announced that passkeys, a passwordless secure login standard, are now available to use on the Chrome browser.

By regularly backing up your data, you can safeguard your important files and documents and minimize the risk of data loss. In this article, we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss the importance of backing up your data and offer some tips for doing it effectively.\nThe importance of backing up your data #In today\u0026rsquo;s digital world, our personal and professional lives are often tied to our data. From important documents and family photos to financial records and business documents, our data is an essential part of our lives. Unfortunately, data can be lost in many ways, from hardware failures and natural disasters to cyber attacks and human error.\nBacking up your data is an important part of protecting yourself against the potential loss of this important information. By regularly backing up your data, you can create a secure, offsite copy of your data that you can use to restore your files and documents in the event of a disaster. This can save you time, money, and frustration and help ensure that your data is always safe and accessible.\nTips for backing up your data effectively #Backing up your data can seem daunting, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be. Here are some tips for backing up your data effectively:\nCreate a backup plan #The first step in backing up your data effectively is to create a backup plan. This plan should outline how often you will back up your data, where you will store the backups, and what data you will include in the backups. By creating a plan, you can ensure that you are consistently backing up your data and that you are including all of the important files and documents.\nUse multiple backup methods #It\u0026rsquo;s also important to use multiple backup methods to ensure that your data is always safe. For example, you might use an external hard drive for daily backups, a cloud storage service for offsite backups, and a physical storage option, such as a USB drive or CD, for additional protection.

Unlike proprietary software, which is owned and controlled by a single company or person, open source software is developed and maintained by a community of volunteers who are dedicated to improving the software and making it as useful and user-friendly as possible.\nThe concept of open source software originated in the late 1980s, when a group of software developers began collaborating on a project to create a free, open source operating system called Linux. Since then, the open source movement has grown significantly, and today there are thousands of open source software programs available in a wide range of category, from operating systems and office suites to photo editing and web development tools.\nBenefits #Open source software has become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. Not only is open source software typically free to use, but it also offers a number of benefits that make it a valuable tool for individuals and organizations alike.\nOne of the key advantages of open source software is that it is typically developed and maintained by a community of volunteers, who are dedicated to improving the software and making it as useful and user-friendly as possible. This means that open source software is often more reliable and better supported than proprietary software, which is developed and maintained by a single company.\nAnother benefit of open source software is that it is typically more flexible and customizable than proprietary software. Because the source code is freely available, users can modify and extend the software to suit their specific needs and preferences. This can be especially useful for organizations that require specialized tools or functionality that is not available in commercial software.\nIn addition, open source software is often more secure than proprietary software. Because the source code is freely available, it can be reviewed and audited by a large community of users, which makes it easier to identify and fix security vulnerabilities. This can give users greater confidence that their data is safe and secure when using open source software.\nFurthermore, using open source software can help support the development of a more diverse and decentralized technology ecosystem. Because open source software is not controlled by a single company, it is less susceptible to monopolies and the potential negative effects that can result from a lack of competition. This can help promote innovation and prevent a single company or group from gaining too much control over the technology landscape.\nSould You Avoid Closed Source Software? #There are several reasons why one should avoid using proprietary software.\nFirst, proprietary software is typically more expensive than open-source alternatives. Because proprietary software is owned and controlled by a single entity, typically a commercial software vendor, who charges a license fee for its use. This can make it more expensive to acquire and maintain proprietary software, especially for large organizations with many users.\nSecond, proprietary software is often less flexible and customizable than open-source software. This is because the source code of proprietary software is not publicly available, which means that users cannot modify or extend the software to meet their specific needs. In contrast, open-source software typically allows users to view and modify the source code, which can make it more adaptable and customizable.\nThird, proprietary software can be less secure than open-source software. The source code of proprietary software is not publicly available, so security vulnerabilities or defects may not be discovered and addressed as quickly as they would be in open-source software. Additionally, because proprietary software is owned and controlled by a single entity, there is a greater risk of security breaches or malicious attacks.\nOverall, while there may be some benefits to using proprietary software, such as access to certain features or support from the vendor, the potential drawbacks of proprietary software, such as higher costs, less flexibility, and lower security, make it advisable to avoid it whenever possible. Open-source software can often provide equivalent or better functionality at a lower cost and with greater flexibility and security.\nSome OSS You Should Use # GIMP (Photo editor) Firefox (Web browser) VLC (Media player) LibreOffice (Office suit) ARCH LINUX Conclusion #Open source software offers a number of advantages that make it a valuable tool for individuals and organizations. It is typically more reliable, flexible, and secure than proprietary software, and it can help support the development of a more diverse and decentralized technology ecosystem. For these reasons, more and more people and organizations are turning to open source software as a viable alternative to proprietary software.\n","permalink":"https://imranmollajoy.github.io/post/pros-of-using-open-source-softwares/","summary":"Open source software is software that is distributed with a license that allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute the software.

In this article, we will explore the differences between SSR and SSG, their respective advantages and disadvantages, and how to decide which approach is best for your specific project.\nWhat is Server-side Rendering (SSR)? #Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique in which a web page is rendered on the server in response to a user\u0026rsquo;s request. This means that when a user visits a website, their browser sends a request to the server, and the server responds by generating and sending back the HTML code for the page. The browser then interprets and displays the HTML to the user.\nAdvantages of SSR #One advantage of SSR is that it can be faster when dealing with a large number of pages. Because the server is responsible for generating the HTML, it can quickly generate and send back many pages at once, which can be useful for websites with a large number of pages or dynamic content. SSR is also useful for websites that require server-side processing, such as authentication, data validation, or server-side rendering of client-side libraries like React or Angular.\nAnother advantage of SSR is that it allows for real-time updates to the page content. Because the server generates the HTML on demand, it can incorporate the latest data or user input into the page, allowing for a seamless and dynamic user experience.\nDisadvantages of SSR #Server-side rendering (SSR) has some disadvantages that may make it less suitable for certain types of projects. One disadvantage is that it can be slower in terms of performance compared to static site generation (SSG). Because the server has to generate and send back the entire HTML code for each page, it can take longer for the page to load, which can be frustrating for users and may reduce the user experience.\nAnother disadvantage of SSR is that it can be more challenging for search engine optimization (SEO). Search engines may have difficulty indexing and ranking pages that are generated on the server, as they may not be able to access and crawl the page content in the same way they can with static HTML files. This can make it harder for your website to rank well in search results, which can reduce its visibility and impact.\nAdditionally, SSR can require more complex server-side infrastructure and code. Because the server has to generate and send back the HTML code for each page, it may require more advanced server-side capabilities and technologies, such as a web application framework, database, or server-side rendering library. This can increase the complexity and cost of development and maintenance, and may make it more difficult to scale and update the website.\nWhat is Static Site Generation(SSG)? #Static site generation (SSG) is a technique in which a website is pre-rendered at build time, rather than being generated on the fly in response to user requests. This means that the entire website is pre-built and saved as a set of static HTML files, which can then be served to users without the need for additional server-side processing.\nAdvantages #SSG has a number of advantages compared to server-side rendering (SSR). One advantage is that it is faster in terms of performance. Because the website is pre-rendered as static HTML files, there is no need for the server to generate and send back the HTML code for each page. This means that the pages can be served to users more quickly, which can improve the user experience and reduce loading times.\nRead more Create a horizontal scroll section in HTML Another advantage of SSG is that it is simpler and easier to implement and maintain. Because the website is pre-rendered as static HTML files, there is no need for complex server-side infrastructure or code, such as a web application framework, database, or server-side rendering library. This can make it easier to develop and maintain the website, and can reduce the cost and complexity of the project.\nAdditionally, SSG can be more suitable for search engine optimization (SEO). Because the website is pre-rendered as static HTML files, search engines can easily access and crawl the page content, which can improve the website\u0026rsquo;s ranking in search results and increase its visibility.\nDisadvantages #One potential disadvantage of static site generation (SSG) is that it is limited to static content. Because the website is pre-rendered at build time, it is not possible to include dynamic data or user-generated content on the site. This can be a limitation for some types of websites or applications that require real-time updates or interactivity.\nAnother potential disadvantage of SSG is that it can be challenging to implement certain features or functionality that are commonly found on modern websites, such as forms, search, or e-commerce. These features typically require server-side processing, which is not possible with SSG. This can make it difficult to create a fully-featured website using only SSG.\nAdditionally, SSG may not be suitable for websites or applications that require a high level of security or privacy. Because the website is pre-rendered as static HTML files, it is not possible to implement server-side security measures, such as authentication or encryption. This can make it easier for attackers to access or compromise the website, and can make it difficult to protect sensitive user data.\nVerdict #In conclusion, static site generation (SSG) is a useful web development approach that has several advantages, including faster performance, easier implementation and maintenance, and better search engine optimization (SEO). However, it also has some potential disadvantages, such as its limitation to static content and difficulty in implementing certain features or functionality.\nWhether to use SSG or not ultimately depends on the specific needs and requirements of the website or application being built. For simple, static websites, SSG may be the best approach. But for more complex, dynamic websites, server-side rendering (SSR), may be more suitable. It is also possible to use a hybrid approach that combines both SSG and SSR in different parts of the site.\n","permalink":"https://imranmollajoy.github.io/post/differences-between-ssg-and-spa/","summary":"Introduction #Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) are two different approaches to web development that are used for different purposes.

They are non-photosynthetic and typically characterized by the presence of chitin in their cell walls. Fungi are found in a wide range of environments, including soil, water, and other organisms, where they play important roles in the ecosystem by breaking down organic matter and aiding in nutrient cycling.\nFungi are essential to the health of many ecosystems, as they are involved in the decomposition of organic matter. This process helps to recycle nutrients back into the environment, making them available for other organisms to use. Fungi are also essential for the production of a number of products, including food (such as mushrooms), beverages (such as beer and wine), and pharmaceuticals (such as penicillin).\nClassification of Fungi #Fungi are typically classified into four major groups: the Chytridiomycota, Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota. Chytrids are aquatic fungi that are influential for the decomposition of organic matter in aquatic environments. Zygomycetes are also decomposers and include influential plant pathogens, such as black bread mold. Ascomycetes are a large and diverse group of fungi that include yeasts, molds, and many plant pathogens. Basidiomycetes are the largest group of fungi and include essential plant pathogens, as well as edible fungi such as mushrooms.\nLife Cycle #Fungi can exist in one of two forms: as a haploid organism (with only one set of chromosomes) or as a diploid organism (with two sets of chromosomes). In the haploid form, fungi reproduce asexually through the production of spores, which are dispersed and can give rise to new individuals. In the diploid form, fungi reproduce sexually through the fusion of two haploid individuals. This process produces a zygote, which can then undergo meiosis to produce new haploid individuals.\nInteraction #In terms of their interactions with other organisms, fungi can be either beneficial or harmful. Many fungi form symbiotic relationships with other organisms, such as plants, where they provide nutrients in exchange for sugars produced through photosynthesis. However, some fungi are also important plant pathogens and can cause significant damage to crops and other plants.\nOverall, fungi are an significant and diverse group of organisms that play crucial roles in the health of many ecosystems. They are involved in the decomposition of organic matter, the production of a number of products, and the establishment of symbiotic relationships with other organisms.\n","permalink":"https://imranmollajoy.github.io/post/a-detailed-article-on-fungi/","summary":"The Role of Fungi in the Ecosystem #Fungi are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that are distinct from animals, plants, and other forms of life.
